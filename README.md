# Babysitter Kata

## Background
This kata simulates a babysitter working and getting paid for one night.  The rules are pretty straight forward.

## Feature
*As a babysitter<br>
In order to get paid for 1 night of work<br>
I want to calculate my nightly charge<br>*

## Requirements
The babysitter:
- starts no earlier than 5:00PM
- leaves no later than 4:00AM
- only babysits for one family per night
- gets paid for full hours (no fractional hours)
- should be prevented from mistakes when entering times (e.g. end time before start time, or outside of allowable work hours)

The job:
- Pays different rates for each family (based on bedtimes, kids and pets, etc...)
- Family A pays $15 per hour before 11pm, and $20 per hour the rest of the night
- Family B pays $12 per hour before 10pm, $8 between 10 and 12, and $16 the rest of the night
- Family C pays $21 per hour before 9pm, then $15 the rest of the night
- The time ranges are the same as the babysitter (5pm through 4am)

Deliverable:
- Calculate total pay, based on babysitter start and end time, and a family.

## Running tests
After cloning the project, at the root of the project, run "mvn test".
Additionally, you could choose to open the project in an IDE, such as Intellij, navigate to the BabysitterCalculatorTest.groovy file and 
run the tests directly from this file. (e.g. on MacOS Intellij, Cntrl-Shift-F10)
